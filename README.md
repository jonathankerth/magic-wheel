# Random Wheel Spinner Component

This project includes a random wheel spinner component built entirely with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's a fun and interactive way to display random selections, and it can be easily integrated into various parts of your application.

This component is part of a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Random Wheel Spinner

The random wheel spinner is a visually appealing component that you can use to showcase skills, present options, or create engaging interactions with users. Utilizing Tailwind CSS, it's highly customizable and easy to fit into your existing design system.

### Usage

You can find the random wheel spinner component in the `src/components/wheel.js` file. Import it into your desired page and use it as a standard React component.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

\```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
\```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
