# Magic Wheel Spinner Component

Welcome to the Magic Wheel Spinner Component project! Built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and part of a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application, this visually stunning random wheel spinner is an engaging way to present selections, showcase skills, or create interactive user experiences.

## Features

### Random Wheel Spinner

The random wheel spinner is more than just an eye-catching component. It's a versatile tool that can be tailored to fit various applications. Utilizing the power and flexibility of Tailwind CSS, you can customize it to match your existing design language.

### Usage

Find the random wheel spinner component in the `src/components/wheel.js` file. Import it into your desired page, and use it like any standard React component.

## Customization

Tailor the look and feel of the spinner to your needs by adjusting the Tailwind CSS classes within the component. Need a different color scheme? Want to resize the spinner? It's all within your control.

## Getting Started

Get the project up and running with these simple steps:

1. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the magic in action.
